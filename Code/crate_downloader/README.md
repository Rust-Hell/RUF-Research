# Crates Downloader

In this project, we will download and decompress all crates source code from crates.io (Cargo Ecosystem). The process can be broke and re-started, as we supoort break-point execution. The data will be stored in `CRATESDIR`(./on_process). 


### Preliminaries

The crate version info are based on DB of our Cargo-Ecosystem-Monitor. Follow the guide in the root directory.
