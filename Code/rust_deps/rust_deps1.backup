20:04:01 [WARN] failed to select a version for the requirement `async-tls = "^0.10.2"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.11.0, 0.10.0, 0.9.0, ...
location searched: `mirror` index (which is replacing registry `crates-io`)

    ... which satisfies dependency `tide-rustls = "=0.1.5"` of package `dep v0.1.0 (/home/loancold/Projects/Cargo-Ecosystem-Monitor/Code/rust_deps)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?
