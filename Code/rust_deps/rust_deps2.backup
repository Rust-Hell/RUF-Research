03:14:11 [WARN] failed to select a version for the requirement `rspirv-reflect = "=0.2.0"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.6.0, 0.5.0, 0.4.1, ...
location searched: `mirror` index (which is replacing registry `crates-io`)
required by package `dep v0.1.0 (/home/loancold/Projects/Cargo-Ecosystem-Monitor/Code/rust_deps)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?

03:14:56 [WARN] failed to select a version for the requirement `rapier2d = "=0.1.0"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.11.1, 0.11.0, 0.10.1, ...
location searched: `mirror` index (which is replacing registry `crates-io`)
required by package `dep v0.1.0 (/home/loancold/Projects/Cargo-Ecosystem-Monitor/Code/rust_deps)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?
