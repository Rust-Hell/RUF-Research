# RUF Lifetime Analysis

We will download all release versions of Rust compiler and analyze its RUF definition to get the status of every RUF though the update of Rust compiler. This helps further analysis of RUF development and its usability and reliability.

This project will first download Rust compiler source codes and then produce its lifetime information.
